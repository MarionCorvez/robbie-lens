## Post-rationalisation


### Colors harmonization

There are two themes: dark (main one) and light.
The light theme is used for main nav, portfolio headings and portfolio's pull on homepage.
Three diferent colors are given for a quite similar "black".


### Margin & harmonization

All navigation items (header & footer) have diferent margin and padding, on mobile and on desktop devices.
Keeping a single value and applying a clamp for responsive padding and margin.
